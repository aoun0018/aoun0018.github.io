        <h2>About me</h2>
         <p>My name is Georges, I'm 21 years old born on May 14<sup>th</sup> 2003 and I have a great interest in drawing, sports, travelling, and technology. I'm currently studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> at <em>Algonquin College</em> in hopes of meeting new people, creating connections, and learning new skills that will help me achieve my future goals. </p>
        
         <p>I am excited to expand my creative knowledge in arts and design from paper drawings to more of the digital side of things. Which include graphic design, website creation, photography, and videography. In hopes of pursuing my dream of travel the world while being able to help different companies with media needs.</p>
